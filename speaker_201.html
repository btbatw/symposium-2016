                    <h2>Yu-Hua Tseng, Ph.D. <br>曾玉華 博士</h2>
                    <h3>Associate Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School</h3>
                    <p>Dr. Yu-Hua Tseng is an Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, an Investigator at the Joslin Diabetes Center, and a Principal Faculty of Harvard Stem Cell Institute.  She received B.S. in Medical Technology and M.S. in Microbiology and Immunology from National Taiwan University (M.S. thesis advisor: Dr. Lih-Hwa Hwang).  She then came to the United State and received Ph.D. in Developmental Biology and Cellular and Molecular Biology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison under the supervision of Dr. Linda Schuler.  She completed postdoctoral training in the laboratory of Dr. C. Ronald Kahn at Joslin Diabetes Center, Harvard Medical School.  The research in Dr. Tseng’s laboratory has been focusing on unraveling the role of developmental signals in brown versus white adipose cell fate, the identification and characterization of progenitor/stem cells that give rise to different adipose depots, and the integration of genetic and humeral factors on thermoregulation and whole body energy homeostasis. Work from Dr. Tseng’s lab has helped establish the role of developmental signals in brown fat biology, and increase our understanding on the physiological role of brown and beige fat in rodents and humans.  Dr. Tseng was an Eleanor and Miles Shore Scholar in Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and received the Hazel K. Stiebeling Lectureship from Florida State University and Visiting Professorship from National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.  She serves, or has served on, the grant review panels for the National Institutes of Health, the American Diabetes Association, the Department of Defense, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Material Command, and the European Research Council.
