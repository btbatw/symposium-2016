                    <h3>Qidza</h3>
                    <p>CDC reports that 1 out 6 children have developmental problems, costing healthcare $30+ billion annually. Yet 52% of pediatricians don’t have time or expertise to screen for developmental issues (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2011). To close the screening gap and offer parents peace of mind, Qidza is a population health mobile platform that enables parents work seamlessly with their physicians to track their children’s developmental milestones and improve their health and well-being.
