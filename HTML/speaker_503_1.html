                    <h3>Senior Director of Oncology, PharmaEssentia Corporation</h3>
                    <p>I am a biologist who has a strong interest in developing novel therapeutics in treating human disease. After completed my post-graduate studies I have spent more 20 years in various biotech and pharmaceutical companies to develop new treatment for autoimmune disease and human cancers in US. I found these experiences are very rewarding, and I have accumulated good and solid working knowledge in understanding the mechanisms and approaches we can take to develop novel biologics and small molecules. Translating preclinical discovery into clinical success is also an area I am currently working on at a research position in PharmaEssentia. Working with my colleagues at PharmaEseentia, we are learning and growing each day via our dedicated research work. I am very happy about this exciting opportunity at PharmaEssentia, a fast growing Biotech company at Taipei.</p>
