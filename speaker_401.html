                    <h3>Associate Professor, NTHU</h3>
                    <p>Dr. Cheng received his B.S. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan in 1999. He received his Ph.D. training in Biomedical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, focused on understanding cell-based biopolymer structures through small-scale approaches, and got his Ph.D. in 2009. Then Dr. Cheng performed his post-doctoral research in Dept. of Chemistry & Chemical Biology at Harvard University until 2011. Cheng’s group at NTHU focuses on developing cellulose-based diagnostic devices for public and food safety; studying cellular and molecular biomechanics and microfabrication, micropatterning through Bio-Inspiration Approaches.
