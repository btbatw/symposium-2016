                    <h3>Asclepiumm Taiwan Co., Ltd</h3>
                    <p>Asclepiumm Taiwan Co., Ltd is a startup biotech company for (1) bio-therapeutic drugs and (2) peptide drugs development. 
(1) The Company has developed an innovative Antibody Switch-on Cytotoxicity (ASC) platform for bio-drug delivery.  This platform utilizes the nature of antibody-antigen interaction and the tumor microenvironment to switch-on and deliver cytotoxic peptides specifically to cancer cells.  The ASC platform provides a breakthrough strategy for bio-therapeutic delivery via efficiently carrying the effector peptides into cells in a non-endocytic pathway. Thus, the effector peptides are not degraded by lysosomes within the cells.  Such advantage allows the ASC platform to be used to generate many innovative therapeutic bio-drugs for unmet medical needs.
Currently, the company is developing ASC-S9, an ASC platform designed bio-drug with effector peptides blocking Hsp90, to treat various cancers including lung, breast, prostate, liver, esophageal and pancreatic cancers.
(2) The Company is also conducting a series of peptide drugs for eye diseases. The Dsg2 peptide drugs are not only novel pathway blockers of angiogenesis to reduce MMP9 activities, but may also be developed as topical use drugs for eye diseases including retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), diabetic macular edema (DME), and wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
