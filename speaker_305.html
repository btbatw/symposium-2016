                    <h3>Senior Director, Inflammation and Immunology Research Unit, Pfizer</h3>
                    <p>Lih-Ling Lin graduated from National Taiwan University with a undergraduate degree in Pharmacy and Master degree in Biochemistry. She then went to University of Arizona for her graduate work. After receiving her PhD degree in Biochemistry, Lih-Ling Lin joined Wyeth (Genetics Institute) and contributed to the discovery of several PLC and cPLA2 family members. She then led a discovery team targeting the signal transduction pathways in innate immunity involved in the production of inflammatory mediators and cytokines (e.g. TNF).  These projects include development of kinase inhibitors and Biologics targeting innate receptors. This effort has led to the discovery of clinical candidates in treating autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Inflammatory Bowel disease.  Lih-Ling currently is leading the Exploratory Innate Immunity group dedicated in the emerging science for the drug discovery effort in the Inflammation and Immunology Research Unit. Lih-Ling is an author of over  70 scientific papers and patents.
